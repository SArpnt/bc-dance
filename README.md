i currently don't give any kind of permission for this to currently be associated with BCMG / TCC: minigame collective  
i didn't agree to any new rules after the switch to TCC:MG so unless the MIT license rule was there from the start this absolutely isn't MIT licensed  
whether it's legal or not doesn't make it moral  
newer versions of this definetly aren't MIT licensed
